This plan focuses on frontend development while leaving clear integration points for Cursor to handle backend connectivity later. Each component will have placeholder data and clear TODO comments indicating where backend integration is needed.




### **BREAK - Of course. Here is a comprehensive status update on the Feebee ERP frontend project, based on our recent detailed analysis.**

### **Project Status Update**

**Overall Phase 1 Completion: ~40%**

While we have established a strong visual foundation and built out extensive UI components for all core modules, our detailed analysis reveals that we are approximately **40%** of the way through achieving the true enterprise-grade functionality outlined in the foundational prompts.

The primary gap is the transition from displaying data in tables to creating **interactive, workflow-driven interfaces** that empower users to perform complex business processes.

---

### **Module-by-Module Breakdown**

- 游리 **Sales & Distribution (SD): 40% Complete**

- **Strengths:** Excellent data tables for the entire sales cycle (inquiries, quotes, orders, etc.).
- **Gaps:** The two most critical interactive features are missing: the **Kanban-style Sales Pipeline** and the **interactive Sales Order Entry form** with its advanced checks (ATP, credit) and product configurator.



- 游리 **Human Capital Management (HCM): 50% Complete**

- **Strengths:** The most comprehensive module so far, with broad UI coverage across 14 functional areas.
- **Gaps:** Lacks key interactive visualizations and workflows, such as the **Kanban Recruitment Pipeline**, an **interactive Organizational Chart**, and dedicated interfaces for **360-degree feedback** and **compensation reviews**.



- 游리 **Materials Management (MM): 40% Complete**

- **Strengths:** Solid data tables for inventory, procurement, and warehouse data.
- **Gaps:** The core workflows are not yet implemented. This includes the **smart Purchase Requisition form** with its approval chain visualization and the **interactive Warehouse Map/Layout** for visual space management.



- 游리 **Financial Management (FI): 30% Complete**

- **Strengths:** A functional UI for the General Ledger (Chart of Accounts).
- **Gaps:** The module is significantly incomplete. UIs for **Accounts Payable (AP)**, **Accounts Receivable (AR)**, and **Journal Entries** are entirely missing.



- 游리 **Authentication & Application Shell: ~50% Complete**

- **Strengths:** A professional login page and a basic marketing site navigation structure are in place.
- **Gaps:** The core security logic (**JWT handling, protected routes**) is not implemented. The in-app navigation shell with breadcrumbs and module-specific context is also missing.



- 游리 **Master Data Management (MDM): 10% Complete**

- **Strengths:** A placeholder component exists.
- **Gaps:** The advanced interfaces for managing Customer and Material master data with data quality workflows are not yet started.





---

### **Prioritized Next Steps**

To align with the project's vision, I recommend we focus on closing these workflow and interactivity gaps. The following roadmap is now reflected in our planning documents:

**Priority 1: Complete Core Module Workflows**

1. **Sales & Distribution:** Implement the **Kanban Sales Pipeline** & **Interactive Sales Order Entry Form**.
2. **Materials Management:** Build the **Purchase Requisition Workflow** & **Interactive Warehouse Map**.
3. **Financial Management:** Create the missing **AP/AR** & **Journal Entry** UIs.
4. **Authentication:** Implement **JWT logic** & **Protected Routes**.


**Priority 2: Refine Application Shell & MDM**

- Build the dedicated in-app navigation shell and the advanced Master Data Management interfaces.


**Priority 3: Advanced Features (Phase 2 & 3)**

- Tackle cross-module analytics, real-time notifications, PWA features, and AI-powered modules.


Based on this update, we are now in a clear position to proceed.

Shall we begin with the highest priority item from our revised plan: **implementing the Kanban Sales Pipeline for the Sales & Distribution module?**



## **BREAK**

That is an excellent and critical question. You've identified a core requirement for any real-world SaaS ERP system: **multi-tenancy**. Your questions get to the heart of how our application will function for actual customers, and it's crucial we address this before proceeding.

While some aspects are backend-heavy, the entire user experience is dictated by how the frontend handles this. Here is a breakdown of how this architecture works and how we will handle it going forward:

### 1. How Customer-Specific Company Information is Integrated

This is handled through a combination of authentication and API design. The process you've helped build so far is the foundation for this.

- **Authentication (The "Key"):** When a user logs in, they select their company (e.g., "Feebee USA"). The `login` function sends the email, password, and `companyId` to the backend.

- `// CURSOR: API call to POST /api/v1/auth/login`



- **The JWT Token (The "Access Pass"):** Upon successful login, the backend will return a JWT (JSON Web Token). Crucially, this token will contain the `userId` **and** the `tenantId` (or `companyId`). This token is the frontend's proof that the user is authenticated and belongs to a specific company.
- **API Calls (The "Scoped Requests"):** Every subsequent API call from the frontend to the backend will include this JWT in the authorization header. The backend (CURSOR's responsibility) will then decode the token, identify the `tenantId`, and ensure that any database query is filtered for that specific tenant.

- **Example:** When the frontend calls `// CURSOR: API call to GET /api/v1/customers`, the backend receives the token, sees the user belongs to `tenant_ABC`, and executes a query like `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE tenant_id = 'tenant_ABC'`.



- **Frontend Role:** The frontend's job is to be "tenant-aware." It doesn't need to know *how* the data is separated, only that it must send the correct token and display the data it receives. The `AuthContext` we built is the central place for managing this token and user/company identity on the client side.


### 2. Dynamic Setup Flow for Onboarding New Companies

You are correct, this is a major feature that is **currently missing**. A customer can't just "use" the ERP without being onboarded. This requires a dedicated **Company Setup & Onboarding Wizard**.

This is a quintessential frontend-driven workflow that orchestrates multiple backend calls. I propose we add this as a new, high-priority epic. The flow would look like this:

1. **Initial Sign-up:** A new customer admin signs up for the ERP service.
2. **Company Profile Creation:** A multi-step form to enter company details (Name, Address, Tax ID, Default Currency).

1. `// CURSOR: API call to POST /api/v1/companies`



3. **Fiscal Year Configuration:** Define the fiscal year start/end dates and accounting periods.

1. `// CURSOR: API call to POST /api/v1/companies/{id}/fiscal-year`



4. **Chart of Accounts Setup:** Offer a choice between pre-defined templates (e.g., "Standard Manufacturing CoA") or a manual setup.

1. `// CURSOR: API call to POST /api/v1/financials/coa/initialize`



5. **User Invitations:** The admin can invite other users from their company.

1. `// CURSOR: API call to POST /api/v1/users/invite`



6. **Module Activation:** A screen to select and confirm the purchased ERP modules (Financials, HCM, etc.).


This entire wizard would be a new set of components and pages, likely starting from a `/welcome` or `/setup` route after the initial registration.

### 3. Data Separation and Customization Management

This is a shared responsibility between the frontend and backend.

- **Data Separation (Primarily Backend):** As described above, this is the backend's core responsibility. The backend architecture must guarantee that Tenant A can *never* see Tenant B's data. The frontend relies on this guarantee.
- **Customization (Shared Responsibility):** This is an advanced enterprise feature. For example, allowing a customer to add a "Loyalty Tier" custom field to the Customer Master screen.

- **Backend Role:** The backend needs to provide a way to store this custom schema (`// CURSOR: API call to POST /api/v1/customization/schemas`) and the corresponding data.
- **Frontend Role:** The frontend must be built to handle this dynamically. Instead of having a hard-coded form, the "Customer Master" screen would first fetch the form schema for the current tenant (`// CURSOR: API call to GET /api/v1/customization/schemas/customer`) and then dynamically render the form fields based on the response. This is a powerful, metadata-driven UI pattern that we would need to build.





### Summary: Is this only a backend concern?

**No, it is fundamentally a frontend concern as well.** While the backend enforces the rules of multi-tenancy, **the frontend builds the user's entire experience of it.** The user onboarding wizard, the dynamic forms, and the consistent filtering of data are all critical frontend responsibilities.

Our current implementation has the basic hooks for this (company selection at login), but we have not yet built the key user-facing workflows like the onboarding wizard.

Thank you for raising this. It clarifies our path forward. I recommend we create a new planning document for this and prioritize the **Company Onboarding Wizard** after we complete the current module review.
